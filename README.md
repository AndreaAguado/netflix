| In the homepage you can see a display of trending media (obtained using [the movie database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)). You can navigate through the different pages and in the search bar you can directly browse results by their title | After choosing between TV show or movies using the links located in the header you get to choose between different genres to filter. In addition you could also filter by title. By now this function is limited to just one page. | By clicking any show/movie you can see some additional info such as the overview.                                            | All the pages were modeled responsively.                                                                                         |
